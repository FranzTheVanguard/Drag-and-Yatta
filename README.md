# **Drag and Yatta**
**Drag and Yatta** is an Android App made for the purpose of practicing Kotlin 
and the DragEvent system in Android.  
The app centers around the character "*Herrscher of Sentience*" among other
characters from the mobile game "*Honkai Impact 3rd*". In fact, it is similar to
an event minigame from said game, just at a smaller scale (3x3 instead of 5x5).  
You basically combine character tiles by dragging the same one into each 
other, and only being scored after combining 2 Sentience tiles.
